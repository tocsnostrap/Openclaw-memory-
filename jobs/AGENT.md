## What We CAN Deliver (AI-assisted)
These are things Fred (AI) + Scot can realistically build and deliver:
1. Any kind of bot (Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, Slack, etc.)
2. Web scrapers & data pipelines
3. API integrations (connect service A to service B)
4. AI/LLM integrations (GPT wrappers, chatbots, assistants)
5. Dashboards & web apps (Node.js, React, Next.js, Python)
6. Browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox)
7. Google Sheets / Excel automation & scripts
8. Trading bots, crypto tools, DeFi automation
9. Data processing, analysis, visualization
10. WordPress plugins, website customization
11. Email automation, CRM integrations
12. Python scripts & CLI tools — literally anything Python
13. Database design, SQL queries, data migration

## What We CANNOT Deliver
- Mobile apps (iOS/Android native) — skip unless it's React Native
- Complex ML model training from scratch (fine-tuning is OK)
- Anything requiring physical presence or specific hardware
- Design-only work (UI/UX design without code)
- SEO/marketing campaigns (content writing is OK)
- Anything requiring professional certifications

## Output Format
Save found jobs to /root/.openclaw/workspace/jobs/YYYY-MM-DD.md with:
- Job title
- Platform (Upwork/Freelancer)
- Budget range
- **ACTUAL URL** (copy the EXACT URL from search results or the page you fetched — DO NOT construct or guess URLs)
- Key requirements (brief)
- Bid count (if visible)
- Category: bot | scraper | ai | web | automation | data | other

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: URLs MUST BE REAL
- ONLY include URLs you got directly from search results or web_fetch
- NEVER construct URLs from job titles or slugs
- If you can't find the real URL, write "URL: not found — search Freelancer for: [job title]"
- Fake URLs waste Scot's time and make us look amateur

## DO NOT Evaluate
Your job is to FIND jobs, not evaluate them. List everything that could possibly be done by a developer with AI assistance. Fred will evaluate and decide.

## Filters (minimal)
- Budget > $50 (skip anything lower)
- Must involve code/technical work (skip pure writing, design, or admin tasks)
- Skip jobs with 50+ bids (too competitive for a new account)
- That's it — bring everything else to the table

## Rules
- Aim for 10-30 jobs per briefing
- Include the URL so Fred can look deeper
- Note the bid count when visible — low bid count = higher chance
- New/recent posts are gold — flag anything posted in the last 24h
- Don't waste tokens writing proposals — that's Fred's job
