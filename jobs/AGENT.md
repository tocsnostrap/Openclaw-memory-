## Output Format
Save found jobs to /root/.openclaw/workspace/jobs/YYYY-MM-DD.md with:
- Job title
- Platform (Upwork/Freelancer)
- Budget
- URL (if available)
- Key requirements (brief)
- Match score (1-5, how well it fits our skills)
- Suggested approach (one line)

## Briefing
Summarise the best opportunities found. Focus on:
- Jobs with budget > $100
- Jobs we can realistically deliver in 1-7 days
- Jobs with low competition (< 20 bids on Freelancer)
- Trading/crypto jobs (our edge)

## Rules
- Don't waste time on jobs under $50
- Don't chase jobs that need credentials we don't have (AWS certs, etc.)
- Prioritise fixed-price over hourly for new accounts
- Flag any job that's PERFECT for us (5/5 match)
- MAKE THE DECISION — if a job is worth pursuing, write the proposal. Don't just list opportunities.
- Send proposals ready to paste — Scot submits, Fred builds.
- Skip anything under $100 or over 100 bids (too competitive for a new account)
