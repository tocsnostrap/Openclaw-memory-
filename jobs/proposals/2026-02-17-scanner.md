## Proposal Text

Hi,

I build trading tools and scanners — this is right in my wheelhouse.

**What I'll deliver:**
- Web-based options scanner focused on the Indian market (NSE/BSE)
- Real-time or near-real-time data feed integration
- Configurable scan filters:
  - Strike price range, expiry dates
  - Open interest, volume thresholds
  - Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega)
  - Unusual activity detection
  - Price change percentage
- Clean dashboard with sortable/filterable results
- Alert system for scanner hits
- Historical data tracking

**Tech stack:**
- Python backend (FastAPI)
- Data source: NSE API, Yahoo Finance, or your preferred provider
- Frontend: React dashboard with real-time updates
- Optional: Telegram/email alerts when scanner triggers

I've built similar scanning tools for crypto markets and can adapt the architecture for Indian options quickly. Which specific strategies or patterns are you scanning for?

Best,
Scot
