# Proposal: RAG Implementation

## Proposal Text

Hi,

I build RAG systems professionally — document ingestion, vector embeddings, retrieval pipelines, and LLM-powered question answering. This is my core specialty.

Here's what I'll deliver:

**Architecture:**
- Document processing pipeline (PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML — whatever your sources are)
- Chunking strategy optimized for your content type (semantic, sliding window, or hybrid)
- Vector embeddings using OpenAI, Cohere, or open-source models (your choice)
- Vector store integration (Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB, or pgvector)
- Retrieval pipeline with re-ranking for accuracy
- LLM integration (GPT-4, Claude, or open-source) with source citations

**What sets me apart:**
- I run my own AI assistant infrastructure daily — RAG isn't theoretical for me, it's production reality
- I optimize for accuracy AND cost — no point building something that burns $500/day in API calls
- Clean, documented Python code you can maintain and extend
- I'll include evaluation metrics so you can measure retrieval quality

Happy to discuss your specific use case and data sources. I can start immediately.

Best,
Scot
