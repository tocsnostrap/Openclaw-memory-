## Proposal Text

Hi,

This is a clean, focused project — I can build this quickly and well.

**What I'll deliver:**
- Web application that generates Ansible playbooks from user input
- Clean UI where users define their infrastructure requirements
- Backend converts selections/inputs into valid, runnable Ansible YAML
- Support for common modules (package installation, file management, service control, user management, etc.)
- Download or copy-paste the generated playbook
- Input validation to ensure generated playbooks are syntactically correct

**Tech stack:**
- Python backend (Flask or FastAPI)
- Clean frontend (React or vanilla JS, your preference)
- Jinja2 templating for playbook generation
- Optional: save/load playbook templates

I can have a working version within 3-4 days. Simple, clean, functional.

Best,
Scot
