## Proposal Text

Hi,

I've built copy-trading systems before — I know the architecture inside out. API connections, position mirroring, risk management, the works.

Here's what I'll deliver:

**Core system:**
- Python-based copy-trading bot connecting to your exchange(s) via API
- Real-time position monitoring of the lead trader
- Automatic trade mirroring with configurable parameters:
  - Position size scaling (percentage or fixed)
  - Maximum position limits
  - Allowed/blocked trading pairs
- Stop-loss and take-profit overrides for risk management
- Trade logging and P&L tracking

**Supported exchanges** (depending on your needs):
- Binance, Bybit, OKX, MEXC, Gate.io, or any exchange with a REST/WebSocket API

**Safety features:**
- Kill switch to stop all copying instantly
- Maximum drawdown limit
- Notification system (Telegram alerts on every trade)
- Dry-run mode for testing without real money

I can start immediately. Which exchange(s) are you working with?

Best,
Scot
