## Proposal Text

Hi,

Python web scraping is one of my strongest skills. I've built scrapers that handle pagination, anti-bot measures, rate limiting, and data normalization at scale.

Here's my approach for your B2B directory scraper:

**What I'll deliver:**
- End-to-end Python scraper targeting your specified German B2B directories
- Handles pagination, JavaScript-rendered content (Playwright/Selenium if needed), and anti-scraping measures
- Clean data extraction: company name, address, phone, email, website, industry, size — whatever fields are available
- Output in your preferred format (CSV, Excel, JSON, or direct database insert)
- Deduplication and data validation built in
- Error handling, retry logic, and logging so it runs reliably

**Technical approach:**
- requests + BeautifulSoup for static sites
- Playwright for JS-heavy sites
- Proxy rotation if the target has rate limits
- Structured, documented code you can rerun or modify later

I can typically have a working prototype within 2-3 days and deliver the complete, tested scraper within a week.

What directories are you targeting? Happy to discuss specifics.

Best,
Scot

**Fred's confidence:** 90% — straightforward scraping job, main risk is if target has heavy anti-bot
