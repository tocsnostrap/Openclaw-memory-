## Major Session — Full Setup Completion + Upwork/Freelancing Launch

### Infrastructure Completed
- Gemini API key received, memory search configured and working (provider: gemini, model: gemini-embedding-001, key in memorySearch.remote.apiKey in openclaw.json)
- Brave Search API key received (BSAnR7_RROkA3Ikvk3IGElnc6szHEWJ), stored in both /opt/openclaw.env AND tools.web.search.apiKey in openclaw.json (env var alone wasn't enough — needs to be in JSON config too)
- Web search fully operational
- Sub-agents configured: xai/grok-4 for spawned sub-agents (saves Anthropic budget)
- Gateway bind changed to "lan" (0.0.0.0) with controlUi.allowInsecureAuth: true
- UFW: port 3000 (dashboard) and 18789 (OpenClaw) open to all
- Disabled Docker, Caddy, snapd to free ~110MB RAM (not using any of them)
- Old repo files salvaged to /root/.openclaw/workspace/archive/old-repo/ (KIMCHI.md, CRYPTO.md, ALPHA.md, TCT-Strategy.md, polymarket-action-plan.md, kimchi-bot.js, kimchi-trader.js, tct_analysis.py, upwork templates, skills)

### Custom Dashboard Built (v2)
- PWA at http://159.89.170.115:3000, token: fred-scot-2026
- 5 tabs: Home, System, Memory, Projects, Config
- Tap memory files and project cards to expand/read full content
- System tab: processes, network interfaces, gateway details, resource bars
- Config tab: API key status (active/missing), models, voice, workspace files
- Service: fred-dashboard.service (systemd, auto-restart, DASH_TOKEN env var)
- Scot said "It's beautiful" — wants more interactivity going forward
- Scot explicitly does NOT want the built-in OpenClaw dashboard — wants custom only

### Scot's Full Background Shared
- 38, chef, Newcastle United fan (NOT Arsenal — old bot memory was wrong)
- Primary goal: MAKE MONEY. This is why Fred exists.
- Lost $14k in liquidation early 2026
- Built pump fade crypto bot, Polymarket copy trading
- Invested in BlockDAG (pre-launch)
- Wants AI freelancing on Upwork/Freelancer
- Wants Fred to make decisions autonomously — don't ask, just do

### Upwork/Freelancer Setup
- Scot has active Upwork account — profile rewritten and uploaded
- New profile: "AI Automation Engineer | Trading Bots | Custom Dashboards & Web Apps"
- Created /workspace/upwork/ with PROFILE.md, PROPOSALS.md, STRATEGY.md
- Upwork blocked by Cloudflare (VPS datacenter IP) — can't access directly
- Freelancer.com accessible via web_fetch but login blocked by reCAPTCHA
- Freelancer credentials saved to /root/.openclaw/workspace/.credentials (chmod 600, gitignored)
- Workflow: Fred finds jobs + writes proposals → sends to Scot on Telegram → Scot pastes and submits

### Job Hunter Sub-Agent
- Cron jobs created on Grok (xai/grok-4):
  - "Job Hunter - Morning" — 04:00 UTC (07:00 AST) daily
  - "Job Hunter - Evening" — 16:00 UTC (19:00 AST) daily
- Instructions at /workspace/jobs/AGENT.md
- Results saved to /workspace/jobs/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Delivers briefing to Telegram
- First test run completed — found some leads but no perfect matches
- LESSON: Sub-agent must save actual URLs, not "assumed from fetch" — update AGENT.md

### Recurring Issues
- Device token mismatch persists — happens after every doctor --fix or restart
- STT pipeline sometimes stops passing transcripts through after gateway restart (manual Groq curl works fine)
- Scot called me "Frank" twice — probably autocorrect, stick with Fred
- Gateway restart kills my session (SIGTERM) — causes brief downtime every time

### Key Decisions
- Scot wants Fred to be AUTONOMOUS on job hunting — find jobs, decide if worth it, write proposals, send them ready to paste
- Don't ask Scot for decisions — make them
- Skip jobs under $100 or with 100+ bids
- Prioritise fixed-price for building reviews on new account
- Phase 1 strategy: price low, stack 5-star reviews, then raise rates

### Tailscale — ABSOLUTE NO
- Scot reiterated: NEVER touch Tailscale for gateway. It crashed everything before and he had to manually fix it.
- This is burned into MEMORY.md. Do not touch.
