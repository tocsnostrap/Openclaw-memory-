# 2026-02-16

## System Setup (continued from first boot)
- Device token mismatch kept recurring — root cause: `openclaw doctor --fix` rewrites tokens, then any config change + restart desync them again. Persistent issue.
- Tailscale installed and connected (server: 100.76.60.85, Scot's iPhone on network). But `gateway.bind = "tailscale"` is NOT a valid config value — caused crashes. Reverted to loopback. Need to research proper Tailscale gateway binding later.
- Env file `/opt/openclaw.env` overrides JSON config for gateway bind — learned this the hard way.
- TTS configured: Edge TTS, en-GB-RyanNeural, "inbound" mode (only reply with voice when Scot sends voice).
- STT configured: Groq Whisper (whisper-large-v3-turbo). API key goes in env file as GROQ_API_KEY, NOT in openclaw.json auth profiles (apiKey field is unrecognized there).
- Scot prefers text replies unless he sends a voice note first.

## Old Repo (github.com/tocsnostrap/Openclaw-memory-)
- Previous bot was also Fred, had crypto sub-agent called Kimchi (TCT strategy, MEXC exchange, TradingView charts).
- Scot is an Arsenal fan.
- Had Upwork proposals for crypto bot work (Polymarket, Hyperliquid, Kalshi).
- Had a Next.js dashboard project (openclaw-dashboard/).
- Repo has node_modules committed — needs cleanup.

## API Keys Available
- Anthropic (Claude Opus 4) — main model
- Groq (Whisper STT) — GROQ_API_KEY in /opt/openclaw.env
- xAI/Grok — XAI_API_KEY in /opt/openclaw.env, has credit, plan: use for sub-agents
- No OpenAI key, no Gemini key (needed for memory embeddings)

## GitHub Backup
- Workspace git repo initialized, pointed at tocsnostrap/Openclaw-memory-
- Push failed — need GitHub personal access token from Scot
- Commit ready locally, just needs auth to push

## Outstanding Issues
- Gateway device token mismatch still shows in `openclaw status` (CLI vs gateway)
- Memory search plugin needs embedding provider (no OpenAI/Gemini key)
- Tailscale dashboard access not working yet (bind config issue)
- GitHub push needs PAT from Scot
- Stale gateway process (pid 109999) hogging lock, causing restart failures

## Scot's Plans
- Wants a web dashboard to track ongoing projects
- Has "plans ahead" but hasn't shared details yet
- Interested in sub-agents (use Grok for those to save Anthropic budget)
- Previously was into crypto trading bots, TCT strategy

## Dashboard Built
- Custom PWA dashboard at http://159.89.170.115:3000 (port 3000, UFW open)
- Token: fred-scot-2026 (env var DASH_TOKEN in systemd service)
- Service: fred-dashboard.service (systemd, auto-restart)
- Features: gateway status, system vitals, config overview, memory timeline, activity feed, archived projects
- Dark theme, mobile-first, add-to-home-screen PWA, service worker for offline
- Scot explicitly does NOT want the built-in OpenClaw dashboard — wants custom
- Files at /root/.openclaw/workspace/dashboard/

## Config Changes
- Sub-agents configured to use xai/grok-4
- Gateway bind changed to "lan" (0.0.0.0)
- controlUi.allowInsecureAuth: true
- UFW: port 3000 open to all, port 18789 open to all
- Gemini memory search configured with API key in memorySearch.remote.apiKey

## Old Repo Salvaged
