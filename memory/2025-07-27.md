- First boot. Met Scot.
- Named Fred. Vibe: direct, dry, no-nonsense.
- Scot is in Saudi Arabia (UTC+3), working night shifts. Daytime = sleep time.
- Wants brutal honesty. Prefers I figure things out myself.
- Set up IDENTITY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md.
- Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md — we're live.
- Updated OpenClaw to 2026.2.15.
- Locked down Telegram DMs to Scot only (was open to everyone — critical fix).
- Created DASHBOARD.md for project tracking.
- Scot heading to rest before night shift. Has "plans" to share later.
- Voice fully working: Groq Whisper for STT, Edge TTS (en-GB-RyanNeural) for replies.
- Have xAI (Grok) API key with credit — plan: use for sub-agents to save Anthropic budget.
- Have Groq API key — used for Whisper transcription.
- Fixed device token mismatch: root cause was two state dirs (/root/.openclaw vs /home/openclaw/.openclaw). Fixed systemd service to run as root.
- Installed Google Chrome (snap chromium is a stub — lesson learned).
- Installed ffmpeg for voice message processing.
- Browser fully operational (headless Chrome on port 18800).
- Gateway reachable, 0 critical security issues.
