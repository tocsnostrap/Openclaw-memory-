# TCT (Test of Composite Theory) - Complete Strategy Guide

Based on Lars Kooistra's TCT Mentorship 2024 + insights from @wyckoff_insider & @moneytaur_

---

## Overview

TCT (Test of Composite Theory) is a Wyckoff-based trading methodology that focuses on identifying when the "Composite Operator" (smart money) is in control of price action. The core idea is to wait for tests at key levels before entering trades.

**Key Principle:** Smart money accumulates before price goes up, distributes before price goes down. Your job is to identify where they're accumulating/distributing and trade in their direction.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Composite Operator (CO)
The "invisible hand" — institutional players driving price. You don't see them directly, but you see their footprint in price action, volume, and structure.

### 2. Control
Who controls price at any given moment?
- **Bulls Control** = Price pushing up with effort (volume)
- **Bears Control** = Price pushing down with effort

### 3. Test
When price returns to a key level to test whether control still holds:
- Buyers return to demand zone = test passed = long
- Sellers return to supply zone = test passed = short

### 4. Confirmation
Entry triggers after a successful test — usually a Break of Structure (BoS) or Change of Character (CHoCH)

---

## Market Structure

### Trend vs Range

**Trending Market:**
- Price makes higher highs (uptrend) or lower lows (downtrend)
- Clear directionality

**Ranging Market:**
- Price trapped between support and resistance
- Consolidation/accumulation/distribution

### Break of Structure (BoS)
When price breaks a prior high/low with momentum — confirms trend continuation

### Change of Character (CHoCH)
When price breaks a prior high/low but shows weakness — signals potential reversal

### Break of Market Structure (BOMS)
Complete structural shift — more significant than a simple BoS

---

## Higher Timeframe Analysis (HTF)

**Always start big, trade small:**

1. **Monthly/Weekly** → Determine overall trend direction
2. **Daily/4H** → Find structure, zones, key levels
3. **1H/15M** → Entry timing, confirmations

**Rule:** Only trade in direction of HTF trend unless you're trading reversals (then look for CHoCH)

---

## Ranges (Accumulation & Distribution)

### Accumulation Range
Where smart money quietly builds long positions:
- Price trades in a defined range (box)
- Volume typically decreases in middle of range
- Look for "springs" (false breakdowns)

### Distribution Range
Where smart money exits/sells:
- Price trades in a defined range
- Volume may increase on sell-offs
- Look for "upthrusts" (false breakups)

### Wyckoff Phases (Extended)
- **Phase A** — Preliminary Stop (PS), Selling Climax (SC), Automatic Rally (AR), Secondary Test (ST)
- **Phase B** — Building cause (accumulation)
- **Phase C** — Spring (test of support)
- **Phase D** — Last Point of Support (LPS), Signs of Strength (SOS)
- **Phase E** — Markup

---

## Supply & Demand Zones

### Supply Zone
Area where sellers have previously overwhelmed buyers:
- Previously rejected from this area
- Strong resistance
- Expect price to fall when returns

### Demand Zone
Area where buyers have previously overwhelmed sellers:
- Previously rejected from this area
- Strong support
- Expect price to rise when returns

### Fresh Zones
Untested supply/demand = higher probability than retested zones

### Weakness/Strength
- Price rejected FROM supply = weakness (keep shorting)
- Price rejected FROM demand = strength (keep buying)

---

## Liquidity

### What is Liquidity?
Areas where stop orders cluster — "fuel" for price movement. Smart money "harvests" liquidity before moving price.

### Liquidity Pools
- **Swing highs/lows** — obvious target for stops
- **Trendline breaks** — liquidity above/below trend
- **Range extremes** — stops beyond the box
- **Buy Side Liquidity (BSL)** — stops above highs (liquidity to chase up)
- **Sell Side Liquidity (SSL)** — stops below lows (liquidity to chase down)

### Market Maker Concept
Market makers/institutions need liquidity to fill orders. They push price to grab liquidity (stop hunt) before moving in intended direction.

---

## Fair Value Gap (FVG)

### What is FVG?
Gap between three consecutive candles where the middle candle's range doesn't overlap with adjacent candles.

### Why It Matters
- Represents inefficiency/empty price space
- Often acts as support/resistance on retest
- FVGs left behind = "tracks"smart money left behind

### Trading FVGs
- Wait for price to retest the FVG
- Enter on confirmation (candle close inside FVG)
- Stop beyond the FVG

---

## TCT Schematics (Entry Patterns)

### Springs
**Definition:** False breakdown below support that quickly reverses
**Interpretation:** Bulls absorbed selling, control still with buyers
**Trade:** Long entry after spring confirmation

### Upthrusts
**Definition:** False breakout above resistance that quickly reverses
**Interpretation:** Bears absorbed buying, control still with sellers
**Trade:** Short entry after upthrust confirmation

### Test Candles
- Rejection wicks at key levels
- Pin bars, hammer-like structures
- Show "rejection" of the level

### Wyckoff Entry Signal (from @wyckoff_insider)
**"Two rise, Two fall, Two rise again"**
- Rhythm pattern before major moves
- Inside bar candles signal preparation
- Entry trigger is subtle — chart "turns into code"

---

## Equal Highs / Equal Lows (EQH/EQL)

### Definition
Price reaching same level multiple times — indicates strong support/resistance

### Trading EQH/EQL
- Multiple touches = stronger level
- Break of EQH = bullish continuation
- Break of EQL = bearish continuation

---

## Entry Checklist

1. ✅ HTF direction identified
2. ✅ Structure identified (trend/range)
3. ✅ Supply/Demand zones marked
4. ✅ Liquidity pools identified
5. ✅ Price returns to test zone
6. ✅ Test candle forms (rejection)
7. ✅ Confirmation (BoS/CHoCH)
8. ✅ Entry triggered

## Position Sizing & Risk Management

### Position Sizing
- Calculate lot size based on stop loss distance
- Never risk more than 1-2% per trade

### Position Sizing by Timeframe (from @moneytaur_)
- **HTF optimal plays** — up to 3% of account (max 5%)
- **HTF semi-optimal** — smaller size
- **LTF scalps** — smallest size
- **MTF plays** — medium size

### Risk/Reward
- Minimum 1:2 R:R
- Better to miss trades than force bad setups

### Stop Loss Placement
- Just beyond liquidity zones
- Beyond the test candle
- Never place stops in obvious spots

---

## Trade Execution

### Entry Types
- **Market orders** — for confirmed moves
- **Limit orders** — for entries at specific levels
- **MO (Market Order)** — for scalps and LTF plays
- **LO (Limit Order)** — for HTF optimal/semi-optimal plays

### The Framework (from @moneytaur_)
**Find > Wait > Play > Profit > Repeat**
1. Find opportunity on charts
2. Set alerts near key levels
3. Wait for confirmation
4. Execute with defined risk
5. Take profit
6. Repeat

### Trade Management
- Scale in/out of positions
- Move stop to breakeven after initial move
- Take partial profits at key levels

### Leverage
- Adjust leverage so liquidation price is BELOW your stop loss
- Higher leverage = tighter stop required

---

## Psychological Indicators

### Emotional Signals (from @moneytaur_)
- **Greed at tops** — "I feel safe holding, this will go up forever"
- **Fear at bottoms** — "I'm going to lose everything, should sell now"
- Your emotions are two of the most powerful indicators

---

## Trading Flow Summary

1. **HTF Analysis** → Direction
2. **Find Structure** → Trend or Range?
3. **Mark Zones** → Supply & Demand + FVGs
4. **Find Liquidity** → Stop hunting areas + BSL/SSL
5. **Wait for Test** → Price at key level
6. **Confirm** → BoS/CHoCH + test candle + FVG retest
7. **Execute** → Enter, manage, exit
