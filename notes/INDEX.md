# Scot's Notes

Organized by Fred. Tell me anything on Telegram — I'll file it here.

## Categories
- [Ideas](ideas.md) — business ideas, money-making schemes, random sparks
- [Trading](trading.md) — crypto notes, strategies, market observations
- [Work](work.md) — freelancing, job notes, client stuff
- [Personal](personal.md) — anything else worth remembering
- [Lists](lists.md) — shopping, to-do, whatever

## How It Works
Just message Fred. He'll sort it. Say "note:" or "remember:" if you want to be explicit, but honestly just say it however you want.
