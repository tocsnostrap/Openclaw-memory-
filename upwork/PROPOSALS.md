## Template: Trading Bot

Hi [name],

I build production trading bots — not prototypes, not tutorials. Real systems that handle real money.

For your [specific requirement], I can deliver:
- [Specific feature 1 based on their listing]
- [Specific feature 2]
- [Risk management / alerts / monitoring]
- Full documentation and deployment

I've built autonomous trading systems for crypto spot/futures, prediction markets (Polymarket), and cross-exchange arbitrage. Happy to show you a demo.

Can start immediately. Let's chat?

## Template: AI Automation / Bot

Hi [name],

I specialise in automation that runs 24/7 without intervention. 

For your project, here's what I'd build:
- [Specific solution mapped to their requirements]
- [Integration details]
- [Monitoring / alerting]

I work fast — most bots and automation projects are delivered within 3-7 days. Clean code, well documented, and I stick around for support.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss details.

## Template: Web Scraping / Data

Hi [name],

I can handle this. Quick questions:
- [1 smart question about their specific data source]
- [1 question about output format / frequency]

I'll build a reliable scraper with error handling, rate limiting, and clean output in whatever format you need (CSV, JSON, database, API).

Typical turnaround: 2-5 days depending on complexity.

## Template: Dashboard / Web App

Hi [name],

I build custom dashboards and web apps — mobile-first, real-time data, clean UI.

For your project:
- [Specific feature mapped to their needs]
- [Tech stack suggestion]
- [Timeline estimate]

I recently built a real-time monitoring dashboard as a PWA (installable on phone like an app). Happy to share a demo.

## Proposal Rules
1. **Never copy-paste generic text** — every proposal references something specific from their listing
2. **Keep it under 150 words** — busy clients don't read essays
3. **Ask 1-2 smart questions** — shows you actually read the brief
4. **Mention relevant experience** — but briefly
5. **End with a clear next step** — "Let's chat?" or "Can start immediately"
6. **No desperation** — confident but not arrogant
