# Upwork Profile - Scot Patterson

## Title
**TCT Trading Specialist | Crypto Bot Developer | Trading Strategy Expert**

## Bio
I build automated trading systems that generate consistent results. My approach combines The Composite Trader (TCT) methodology with AI-powered automation to identify and execute high-probability trade setups.

What I deliver:
- Custom crypto trading bots (Binance, MEXC, Bybit, Gate)
- TCT strategy implementation (supply/demand, liquidity, market structure)
- Trading automation with risk management
- Portfolio management systems

I've developed my own autonomous trading bot that runs 24/7, scanning markets and executing trades. Now I'm helping others build similar systems.

Focused on sustainable trading, not get-rich-quick schemes. Every strategy includes clear risk parameters.

## Skills
- Trading Strategy (TCT, Price Action, Technical Analysis)

- TradingView Automation
- Risk Management
- API Integration

## Hourly Rate
$75-150/hr (depending on project scope)
