# Upwork Profile — Scot Patterson

## Title
**AI Automation Engineer | Trading Bots | Custom Dashboards & Web Apps**

## Overview / Bio

I build things that run while you sleep.

Trading bots, AI-powered automation, custom dashboards, Telegram/Discord bots, web scrapers — if it can be automated, I've probably already done it. My systems handle crypto markets 24/7, monitor data feeds in real-time, and deliver results without babysitting.

**What I deliver:**
→ Custom trading bots (crypto, prediction markets, arbitrage)
→ AI automation & workflow tools
→ Real-time dashboards & monitoring systems
→ Telegram / Discord / WhatsApp bots
→ Web scraping & data pipelines
→ API integrations (any platform)

I've built production trading systems that handle real money on Binance, MEXC, Bybit, and prediction markets like Polymarket. I don't build demos — I build things that work.

Fast delivery. Clean code. No fluff.
