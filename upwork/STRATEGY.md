# Upwork Strategy

## Phase 1: Build Reviews (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal:** Get 5-10 five-star reviews as fast as possible.

- **Price low** — $30-50/hr or competitive fixed prices. We need reviews, not max revenue yet.
- **Target quick wins** — jobs that can be done in 1-3 days:
  - Simple Telegram/Discord bots ($100-300)
  - Basic web scrapers ($150-400)
  - API integrations ($200-500)
  - Small automation tasks ($100-300)
- **Over-deliver** — deliver more than promised. Add a small bonus feature. Be fast.
- **5-star strategy** — communicate clearly, deliver early, ask for feedback.

## Phase 2: Raise Rates (Weeks 5-8)
**Goal:** Establish $65/hr baseline with proven track record.

- Raise rates to $65/hr
- Target meatier projects:
  - Trading bots ($500-3,000)
  - Full dashboards ($1,000-5,000)
  - AI automation systems ($500-3,000)
- Start bidding on "expert" level jobs
- Build out portfolio with screenshots and case studies

## Phase 3: Scale (Month 3+)
**Goal:** $100+/hr, repeat clients, invitations.

- Raise to $100/hr
- Focus on trading/crypto niche (highest paying)
- Build repeat client relationships
- Get "Top Rated" badge
- Accept invite-only jobs (higher budget, less competition)

## Daily Routine
1. Scot sends me interesting job listings (or searches the categories above)
2. I write a tailored proposal in minutes
3. Scot submits it
4. When we land a job, I build it, Scot communicates with client
5. Deliver fast, get 5 stars, repeat

## Key Metrics to Track
- Proposals sent per week (target: 15-20)
- Response rate
- Jobs landed
- Revenue
- Average rating
- Time to first review

## Competitive Edge
- **Speed** — AI-assisted development means we deliver 3-5x faster than solo freelancers
- **Breadth** — we cover Python, JS, APIs, bots, dashboards, scraping, AI — most freelancers specialise in one
- **Availability** — Fred works 24/7, so turnaround times are genuinely faster
- **Quality** — clean code, documentation, over-delivery
