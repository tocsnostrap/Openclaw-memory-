## Job Details
- **Client:** Looking for Polymarket bot developer
- **Budget:** $2,000 fixed
- **Requirements:** Market-making bot for 15-minute markets

## My Proposal

Hi,

I specialize in building automated trading systems for crypto prediction markets. I've developed my own autonomous trading bot that runs 24/7 using TCT (The Composite Trader) strategy.

Here's what I can deliver:

**For your Polymarket bot:**
- Market-making strategy implementation
- 15-minute market algorithms
- Real-time price monitoring
- Automatic order placement
- Risk management parameters
- Telegram/Discord alerts

**Why me:**
- I build real, working trading systems (not just理论)
- Experience with exchange APIs (Binance, MEXC, Gate)
- Strong understanding of market structure and liquidity
- Focus on sustainable, rule-based strategies

I'm ready to start immediately. Can discuss details in chat.

Best,
Scot
