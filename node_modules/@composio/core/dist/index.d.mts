/**
 * Error thrown when toolkit version is not specified for manual tool execution.
 *
 * This error is thrown when attempting to execute a tool manually (via `tools.execute()`)
 * and the resolved version is "latest" without `dangerouslySkipVersionCheck` set to true.
 *
 * **Why this error exists:**
 * Using "latest" version in manual execution can lead to unexpected behavior when new
 * toolkit versions are released, potentially breaking your application. For production
 * use, it's recommended to pin specific toolkit versions.
 *
 * **How to fix:**
 * 1. Specify a concrete version in the execute call
 * 2. Configure toolkit versions at SDK initialization
 * 3. Set toolkit version via environment variable
 * 4. Use dangerouslySkipVersionCheck (not recommended for production)
 *
 * @example ❌ This will throw ComposioToolVersionRequiredError if toolkitVersions is 'latest'
 * ```typescript
 * await composio.tools.execute('GITHUB_GET_REPOS', {
 *   userId: 'default',
 *   arguments: { owner: 'composio' }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example ✅ Fix 1: Pass specific version in execute call
 * ```typescript
 * await composio.tools.execute('GITHUB_GET_REPOS', {
 *   userId: 'default',
 *   version: '20250909_00',
 *   arguments: { owner: 'composio' }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example ✅ Fix 2: Configure toolkit versions at SDK level
 * ```typescript
 * const composio = new Composio({
 *   toolkitVersions: { github: '20250909_00' }
 * });
 * await composio.tools.execute('GITHUB_GET_REPOS', {
 *   userId: 'default',
 *   arguments: { owner: 'composio' }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example ✅ Fix 3: Use environment variable
 * ```typescript
 * // Set: COMPOSIO_TOOLKIT_VERSION_GITHUB=20250909_00
 * await composio.tools.execute('GITHUB_GET_REPOS', {
 *   userId: 'default',
 *   arguments: { owner: 'composio' }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example ⚠️ Fix 4: Skip version check (not recommended for production)
 * ```typescript
 * await composio.tools.execute('GITHUB_GET_REPOS', {
 *   userId: 'default',
 *   dangerouslySkipVersionCheck: true,
 *   arguments: { owner: 'composio' }
 * });
 * ```
